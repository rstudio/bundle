Description: Typically, models in 'R' exist in memory and can be saved via
    regular 'R' serialization. However, some models store information in
    locations that cannot be saved using 'R' serialization alone. The goal
    of 'bundle' is to provide a common interface to capture this
    information, situate it within a portable object, and restore it for
    use in new settings.
